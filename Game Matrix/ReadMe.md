BonkHeads\
\
In the game, you must try to kill all the enemies without them touching you.\
You can kill an enemy by jumping with the head into the platform that it is standing on, making it inert. Then move over the now idle enemy to destroy it, before it revives.\
The game has multiple levels, and a boss at the end.\
You can gain lives by gaining enough score points.\
