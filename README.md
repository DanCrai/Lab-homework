# Robotics Lab Homework
Robotics homework\
Repository for the Introduction to Robotics course\
\
Homework 1: analog RGB Control\
Read 3 values (from 3 potentiometers) and pass them to a RGB Led.\
\
Homework 2: Knock Detector\
Use passive buzzer to detect knocks on the table. After 5 seconds a song is played (through the active buzzer). Used a pushbutton to stop the song.\
\
Homework 3: 4 Digit 7 Segment controlled with joystick\
Use X-axis to switch to the digit you want to change. Press the button to select said digit. Use Y-axis to change the value of the digit. Press button again to deselect it, thus making the X-axis available again. Each digit has 3 states: not hovering/selecting (shown as normal), hovering but not selected - the current digit that you are at (shown as blinking), and selected (shown as blinking with the decimal point led also on)
\

Homework 4: Creating a Game Menu on the display (controlled with joystick)\
The menu has 4 options: new game, load game, highscore and settings. New game starts a game on the starting level with 3 lives. Level increases every 5 seconds, and a life is lost every 10. The highscore saves the highest score and the name. The name and starting level can be changed in settings. (to go back to the menu from setting use the X-axis on the joystick - detecting left input).\
